This is a repository for the students of St.Joseph's college working under me.

# Rules of the repository:
1. When you make a commit to the repository, please write what you are commiting.
2. When you upload something upload it in the folders and keep the root directory clean.
3. The research papers need to be in the ".pdf" also known as the "portable document format".
4. Research papers need to have a naming convention - "paper title" underscore author names.
